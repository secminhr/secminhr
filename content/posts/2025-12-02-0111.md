From the editorial:
> We can freely use every battery except the largest 4 to increase the total running time. Because we can freely swap batteries in 0 time, all the extra power is interchangeable. We can take this extra power and "transfer" it to the batteries in live. Let extra be the sum of all the extra power.

It seems to me that it claims that the number of batteries in the "extra" part doesn't matter, but how could 7 batteries with power 1 the same as 1 batteries with power 7?

I couldn't see it.
